# The IPv4 and IPv6 addresses that the new root should respond to
#   At least one of "ipv4" and/or "ipv6" **must** be given in this file

#   Multiple values are separated with spaces
#   Do *not* include either IPv4 or IPv6 loopback addresses here

# Type of key for the KSK
#   Must be rsa2048 or rsa4096 (more options will be added later)

# Emit the wrong trust anchor
#   This is probably only useful for testing key rollovers where
